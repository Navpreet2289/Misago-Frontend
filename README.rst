Misago Frontend
===============

This repository contains source for Misago frontend, written using React.js 16 and Bootstrap 4.

Ultimately this respository will contain source assets and build scripts, enabling those looking to develop custom theme for their site to simply fork this repo, edit its config and then happily hack around.

But until this stage of development is achieved, this repo will be iterated on aggressively and include some additional files (like work in progress Django templates) that will be moved on to main repo before release.

Tread carefuly.
